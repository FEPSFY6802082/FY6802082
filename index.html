      While much of the car world is focused on developing Electric Cars to reduce carbon emissions in the future
      there are a now many brands that are developing synthetic fuels instead. These fuels are showing to reduce 
      carbon emissions compared to current fossil fuel cars and may even compete with electric cars. The question
      is will these fuels be able to compete with the electric car market or will they fade into the background
      like hydrogen fuel cell cars have? This article explores what synthetic fuels are, who is working on them,
      and what their downsides and upsides are. (Porsche, no date; Formula 1, 2021; Saxton 4x4, 12/05/2023).

      The problem with current fuel sources for transport is that they, since 2016, have become the largest emitter 
      of greenhouse gasses and have stayed like that since then even though electric cars have been introduced and 
      have been becoming more and more popular but even electric cars have a significant effect on adding to the 
      emissions because they arenâ€™t as green as they seem because when they are made they produce lots of green 
      house gasses but it is in the short term. This is where synthetic fuels come in. They are a way to reduce
      green house gas emissions directly and indirectly. (Department for Transport, 19/10/2023; Porsche, no date).
