      While much of the car world is focused on developing Electric Cars to reduce carbon emissions in the future
      there are a now many brands that are developing synthetic fuels instead. These fuels are showing to reduce 
      carbon emissions compared to current fossil fuel cars and may even compete with electric cars. The question
      is will these fuels be able to compete with the electric car market or will they fade into the background
      like hydrogen fuel cell cars have? This article explores what synthetic fuels are, who is working on them,
      and what their downsides and upsides are. (Porsche, no date; Formula 1, 2021; Saxton 4x4, 12/05/2023).

      The problem with current fuel sources for transport is that they, since 2016, have become the largest emitter 
      of greenhouse gasses and have stayed like that since then even though electric cars have been introduced and 
      have been becoming more and more popular but even electric cars have a significant effect on adding to the 
      emissions because they aren’t as green as they seem because when they are made they produce lots of green 
      house gasses but it is in the short term. This is where synthetic fuels come in. They are a way to reduce
      green house gas emissions directly and indirectly. (Department for Transport, 19/10/2023; Porsche, no date).

      Synthetic fuels, also known as eFuels, are a fuel source that is made from hydrogen and carbon from water and
      the air. “Hydrogen is generated via electrolysis, which involves passing a direct current through water. The 
      hydrogen is split off and collected at the negative pole (cathode). Carbon dioxide, the other essential component
      for producing eFuels, is drawn straight from the ambient air using a process called direct air capture. Large fans
      blow air through filters in which the carbon dioxide contained in the atmosphere is deposited. Methanol synthesis
      causes the H2 and CO2 to react and produce eMethanol (CH3OH), which then goes through methanol-to-gasoline (MtG)
      synthesis and is converted into synthetic, straight-run petrol.” (Porsche, no date). This process is all carbon 
      neutral due to the electricity being generated by renewable sources such as a wind turbine.

      The main people that are developing synthetic fuels are Formula 1, Porsche, Audi and BMW. Porsche currently has 
      a synthetic fuel plant in Chile being run on a wind turbine which operates at full load for an average of 270 
      day a year. They are focusing development on e-petrol. (Porsche, no date). Formula 1 will be using synthetic 
      fuels in 2025 when they bring in the new power units. (Formula 1, 2021). Audi have designed a plan for producing
      e-diesel in Switzerland. (Audi MediaCenter, 11/08/2017). BMW is investing in Prometheus Fuels, a company that plans
      to remove carbon-dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and convert it into gasoline. (Stephen Edelstein, 10/06/2020).

      In 2022 Porsche produced 130,000 litres of their eFuel and expect 55 million litres to be produced by 2024 and
      550 million litres by 2026 and this just from 1 plant (Porsche, no date). To keep up with current fuel usage of
      the USA, they would have to build 930 of this small plants. Last year, Americans used 509.9 billion litres of fuel
      a year which has stayed roughly the same from the year before but is about 20-30 billion litres difference to 
      what it was before the pandemic (see table 1/graph 1) (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023).

      There are about 5 different options for the future with varying degrees of sustainability. These are: Biofuels, 
      Electricity, Hydrogen fuel cell, hybrid cars and obviously synthetic cars. 
      
      Biofuel – “Biofuels such as bioethanol (which can be used instead of petrol), are made from corn and sugarcane, whereas
      biodiesel is made from vegetable oils and animal fats. Both replace non-renewable crude oil-derived fuels. The 
      best types are second generation biofuels which are produced from sustainable sources rather than those grown for
      food. Many consider them the best medium term solution to sustainable fuels.” (RAC, 11/03/2020)
      
      Electricity: “Electric cars, powered by a motor with energy supplied by batteries, are becoming increasingly popular.
      Battery efficiency is still limited though, meaning most offer a maximum range of around 100 miles (and take several 
      hours to recharge). Electric cars are currently the most commercially available solution with many models ranging 
      from £5,000 to £400,000 available today.” (RAC, 11/03/2020)
      
      Hydrogen fuel cells: “Hydrogen fuel cells convert hydrogen into electricity to power the car’s motor. They emit only
      water and heat as by-products, making them a very clean alternative to petrol and diesel. However, they are still in
      the early stages of development and there are currently very few hydrogen refuelling stations.” (RAC, 11/03/2020)
      
      Synthetic fuels: “Synthetic fuels are made from carbon dioxide and renewable energy sources such as wind or solar
      power. They can be used in existing petrol or diesel engines without modification.” (RAC, 11/03/2020)
      
      Hybrid cars: “Hybrid cars use a combination of an internal combustion engine and an electric motor to power the car.
      They offer better fuel efficiency than traditional petrol or diesel cars but still rely on non-renewable fossil fuels.”
